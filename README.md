# About Me
Hi, I'm Jay! I'm a backend programmer and web developer with more than 6 years of experience.

I have experience in C++, C#, Lua, HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. I'm always looking to learn new languages and improve my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy woodworking, mechanical engineering some random things, and playing video games.

You can always check out my projects, and what I'm working on.

Thanks for stopping by!
